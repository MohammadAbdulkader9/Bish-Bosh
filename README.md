 Bish-Bosh lists all numbers between 1 and 100, but some exceptions: If
          the number is evenly divisible with 3, 'Bish' is listed instead of the
          number. If the number is evenly divisible by 4, 'Bosh' is listed
          instead. If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 4,
          'Bish-Bosh' is listed instead of the number.
